i want to tell you about the time i discovered the book of the dead the year was 500 A.D and my tribe lived in thatched huts
deep in the rain forest we were proteceted by a ring of elder trees encircling our village 
magically the trees stayed the evil of the forest away from our people
well so we were told by the magi who ruled over us
one year our food ran scarce and it was agreed that one of the tribe must go beyond the elder trees
into the forest to hunt the magi wanted to put it up to a vote 
but i saw him for the false face that he was there was nothing beyond those trees
i volunteered and left the next morning after a great celebration of my bravery
the thick fog had built up in the forbidden world around what my brothers and sisters called hammadi
which in your words means something closer to cocoon i hatched from my cacoon
that day fantasies in my head trudging back to my people with a fat deer under each arm 
arrow quills judding still from their hearts
we would feast upon venison that night salt the rest and save the bones for more long term use 
i would give them half a year of life and when the time came i would venture out once more
i would tell them i am protected where all others are forbidden or at least the ones too afraid to find out
they all thought i was mad to leave the protection of the elder trees but soon they think of me as their savior
i had already seen one of us die pharaoh the young one the first starving death in each generations
i remember pharaohs parents screaming as my father buried their boy
they were reaching out their necks swollen with screams
all because of this horrible cocoon around us that kept us hungry kept us afraid
the elder trees drooped as i passed them hunching over in a sudden gust of wind
reaching out with their limbs like grieving parents howling in the wind as i entered the fog
my first day i slew a boar with my bow and arrow twas a clean kill piercing the skull
i retrieved my arrow as i would feast upon it the next day
because the sheath of moss elated over myself to stay warm throughout the night
i woke up with a star still over me but the boar was gone
something had snatched it clean i could not track the culprit as there were no prints
surely i would have heard something perhaps this was a new different creature i was not prepared for
perhaps the trees really did keep something out my second day was spent forgetting such silly thoughs
i broke my fast on trout from a nearby stream the world outside my village was beautiful anything new was beautiful at first
if even just for a moment my third day was when i begged the elder trees to forgive me
i had woken from a nightmare as the sun barely crested over the mountains i dreamt i was an old man watching my children die
the true nightmare was in fact haunched over me losing hot saliva onto my neck
in the first beam of morning light i saw its face and screamed it snarled and snapped at me
finding only dirt as i scrambled to its backthe dagger i kept by my side was in its neck now its red fur bristled in anger 
and steaming blood poured from its mouth i saw black quills shoot up across its spine and then i threw it to the ground
this is when i finnaly got a look at what the elder trees had been keeping out 
our magi called him abaddon beast that guards the gates of hell red hound with the face of death
two leathery wings flexed from its shoulders and it beat them now uttering away blood streaming from its neck and mouth
i readied my arrow and let it fly through piercing the beasts right wing it howled spinning into a dense thicket ahead
i took a knee know and begged forgiveness from the elder trees the beast was real but i would slay it
abaddon was bleeding to death in a patch of flattened ivy squealing like he mustve when he was only a pup
the same pain of guilt came to me then as when i put a boar to its death this fiery beast before me had skin rippling with heat
was no more than a rabbit staring through begging eyes which i had to ignore if i wanted to save my people
i made sure it was dead ripping my blade through its throat and gutting it i disconnected the hear and pierced it 
which werent to turn to hot ash in my hand thats when i spotted the corner of the book poking from the creatures exposed guts
i cut the membrane away from it watching the shape of it come into recogniton 
wed had books in our village but this was new cover was written in a foreign language
and that worried me because perhaps i couldnt read it unfortunately i found that i could understand every word
looking at the first page i saw only names old names written in old languages
i flipped forward looking for where the story began but it was nothing but names
the entire book was a list of names i skipped to the end where i found nothing but blank pages 
i flipped back a bit to the middle where i found a page writing itself still just names
i stared at them realizing this was the culmination of their lives i was the watcher now
i saw my name on that page but then a new page began as if i had been skipped
it was not until 80 years later when i saw my childrens names in that book did i realize my nightmare had only just begun
thousands of years passed me by as i read the book of the dead i could not pull myself away
i had to know every name every story i did not eat yet i never starved
i did not sleep i only watched the names fill the page
once the page was finished a gust of wind would flip the next one and the writing would resume
it never ended each name had a story each entry required an audience wild vines grew around my body 
no matter how much i wished for the book to reach its end it was always only halfway finished
i thought of how my name was skipped and did it meant that this was my calling
i created stories in my head from the names that i saw
i imagined strange lives for them wondering how they found their way to my book
this one was stung my a metal bird this one was hit with an arrow while thanking the ones who named him king
but it wasnt an arrow it was something else
i got feelings sometimes from the names i read i knew that something had replaced the arrow
the pages had filled faster ever since it was discovered one day i finally saw the elder trees again
they were chopped to pieces in the back of a steel wagon and it felt the same as when i didnt believe in magic
because they were dead now thousands of years of protection ended by mens screaming hatchets 
these spirits guarded men and were thanked with death
of all the death i had seen my family my friends my children this was the first to make me weep
but that still cannot forgive me for what i did next
i could see his name in the book it was javiar he came to me wearing strange armor a bright yellow helmet and glowing vest
he saw me somehow beneath the roots and vines that had entombed me cocooned me 
he cleared them away and asked if i was alright
he carried one of the sceaming hatchets that killed the elder trees i simply handed him the book and now i am free
